# Neural-Network-Language-Model
A simple neural network language model used to analyze text and relationships between words in high dimensional representation space. 
* Encode each word into its vector representation, and the model can be used to predict the fourth most likely word after inputting first three words
* Cluster words into their most likely group on a 2D space
